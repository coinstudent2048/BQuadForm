# BQuadForm

An implementation of some mathematics of "Class group of Positive-definite Binary Quadratic Forms" in Python 3

Implementation of some applications especially in cryptography yet to be decided.

**WARNING:** Use the exact codes only for prototyping. For production usage, the codes **must be properly modified and audited!**
